# Data integrity - I like to see if / where there are any missing values.

#### ~ dates

## Making relevant amendments based on my obeservation (from Data Integrity) and other requirements detailed below:
### Adding Health Board Names
### Amending data or Removing columns based on their value / usefulness to answering our business objectives eg
### Formatting the date and creating a new column called 'week_ending_amended'
### Factoring the age_group column to a particular order and putting it in a column called age_group_fct
### ~ removing the following columns: hbqf, age_group_qf, sex_qf, admission_type_qf
